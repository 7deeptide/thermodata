python-thermodata
=================

This repository contains Python code for interfacing with the library
of thermodynamic data distributed with the NASA Glenn computer
program, CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications), by Bonnie J.
McBride and Sanford Gordon. 

CEA is a FORTRAN program for calculation of complex chemical
equilibrium compositions and applications, [available on the
web][CEA]. Its thermodynamic database contains data for over 2000
chemical species in both gasoues and condensed state. The data are
expressed as least-squares coefficients of a polynomial function of
temperature over defined temperature intervals. The coefficients were
generated by another NASA Glenn program, PAC (Properties and
Coefficients), from a wide range of source data.

This code is intended to serve as a Python-native way of accessing
and representing the data with some basic functionality including:

  - Tabulating data.
  - Generating subsets of the original data format for use with CEA or
	other programs designed to read from the source.
  - Searching/browsing capability.

Note that [ThermoBuild][] provides this functionality and in a more
user-friendly manner. However, it is not suited for programmatic
access to and employment of the data. Currently this code essentially
emulates the basic features of [ThermoBuild][].

  - CEA program interface. 
  - Functionality extension.
