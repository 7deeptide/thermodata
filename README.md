python-CEA
==========

This repository contains Python code for interfacing with the library
of thermodynamic data used in the NASA Glenn computer program, CEA
(Chemical Equilibrium with Applications), by Bonnie J. McBride and
Sanford Gordon. 

CEA is a FORTRAN program for calculation of complex chemical
equilibrium compositions and applications, [available on the
web](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/CEAWeb/index.htm). Its thermodynamic
database contains data for over 2000 chemical species in solid, liquid
and gaseous states. The data are expressed as least-squares
coefficients of a polynomial function of temperature over defined
ranges. The coefficients generated by another NASA Glenn program, PAC
(Properties and Coefficients), from a wide range of source data.

This code hopefully serves as a clean way of accessing this database
outside of CEA, providing searching/subset functionality as well
as alternate data storage formats.

TODO
----

Build a sensible CEA program interface.
