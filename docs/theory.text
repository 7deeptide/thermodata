Specific gas constant
---------------------

The specific gas constant, $R_i$, of a gas, $i$ is related to the
molar gas constant, $R$ by the molar mass of the gas, $M_i$.

$$R_i = \frac{R}{M_i}$$

For dry air with a relative molar mass of $M_i = 28.96 g/mol$, $R_\text{Air} = 287.058 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg K}}$
